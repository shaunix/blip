This is Pulse, a program for displaying various statistics of questionable
relevance about programs and the people who make them.  If you're working
on Pulse, then Pulse is probably working on you.

Here's some basic instructions for running Pulse on your machine:

*) Install sqlobject.  (On Fedora, the package is python-sqlobject.)  For
   your own sanity, I recommend sqlobject >= 0.9.

*) Make sure you have python-sqlite installed.  There seem to be problems
   when using PySqlite2.

*) Edit pulse/config.py.  It's just a bunch of file and URL paths.  The
   necessary edits should be fairly obvious.

*) All the database updates are done by the program 'pulsate'.  To get
   started, run 'pulsate init'.  You can see the various things you can
   do with 'pulsate --help'.  A good order to run things in to get started:
     pulsate init
     pulsate jhbuild
     pulsate modules
     pulsate docs
     pulsate i18n
     pulsate icons

*) If you want to edit pulsate, all of its funtionality is in the files under
   the pulse/pulsate directory.  Each pulsate command is a Python file.  If
   you do add features, many of the commands take the following useful options:
     --no-update     - don't do CVS/SVN/etc updates
     --no-timestamps - don't check file timestamps, which
                       could otherwise cause your new code
                       to never be called

*) To run the web front end, set up Apache.  I just use the one built into
   Fedora.  Your distro probably packaged it as well.  You need to edit
   web/htaccess to reflect the paths on your system.  Note that RewriteRule
   really wants to see absolute paths.  Then symlink as follows:
     web/data       ->  $(webroot)/data
     web/var        ->  $(webroot)/var
     web/index.cgi  ->  $(webroot)/index.cgi
     web/htaccess   ->  $(webroot)/.htaccess
   Note that htaccess should become .htaccess.  I just prefer not to work
   on hidden files in the repository.

*) If you want to edit the web stuff, all the pages are generated by the
   files in the pulse/pages directory.  Basically, index.cgi takes extra
   path components from PATH_INFO and uses the first part of that to call
   the appropriate Python module.  The PATH_INFO strings are more-or-less
   the 'ident' fields of the objects in the database.

*) Ask Shaun to write a paragraph here about the database design.

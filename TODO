* Look for plugins.  Here's a list of applications suggested by various folks on IRC: 
- key files
  - eog
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=462338v
  - epiphany

* Add support for "forums", where a forum might be a web forum, a mailing list,
or anything else where people post things.  Track all posts, including who sent
them and the parent post.  Make activity graphs.


* Track package releases and tie them into modules.  It would be great to get
the part of the NEWS file relevant to that release.


* Rethink how we store revisions.  Currently, we store them both per-repository
and per-file for files we care about.  Various things get weird with this.  It
would be much nicer if we could just store revisions and attach them to files,
but we have to make sure the selections don't get slower.


* We should be able to get the default assignee and QA contact for each bugzilla
product/component mentioned in the database, so that we can display that information
here.  If it's a person (rather than a -maint alias), we should also tag that to
the person's affiliations.  Also, we should be able to see if each person has
administrative rights over a bugzilla product.


* Check all the TODO items below:

* We should be able to get the list admins for each mailing
list.  That's an affiliation for lists and for people.

* Luis says, while graphs are good, it would be more useful
to see activity deltas.  This can provide a good way to see
when and where there are sudden bursts of activity.

* Track foundation members.

* Internationalize everything using the Accept-Language
HTTP header.

* We should write some TODO notes about what we want to see
for our documentation listings.

* We should write some TODO notes about what we want to see
for our translation listings.

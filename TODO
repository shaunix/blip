* Many modules have multiple programs and libraries.  It would
be nice to track these: who works on them, what documentation
covers them, etc.

* We want to see all posts to all mailing lists in our database.
This will be used to construct the activity pulse for the mailing
lists, as well as the mailing list pulse for modules, translation
teams, people, etc.

* It would be nice to track releases, possibly by getting a beat
from the install-module script.  It would be really nice to get
the part of the NEWS file relevant to that release, and to be
able to pin each release to a branch.

* We want to see all commits to every module in our database.
This will give us the activity for each module/branch/etc, as
well as the commit activity for each person.  It would be nice
to see the documentation commit activity and translation commit
activity for each person separately from the whole.

* We should be able to get the default assignee and QA contact
for each bugzilla product/component mentioned in the database,
so that we can display that information here.  If it's a person
(rather than a -maint alias), we should also tag that to the
person's affiliations.  Also, we should be able to see if each
person has administrative rights over a bugzilla product.

* We should be able to get the list admins for each mailing
list.  That's an affiliation for lists and for people.

* Luis says, while graphs are good, it would be more useful
to see activity deltas.  This can provide a good way to see
when and where there are sudden bursts of activity.

* Track foundation members.

* Make xmldata able to return a dict of values for nodes
with xml:lang, and make the xml-source updater able to
handle these.

* Internationalize everything using the Accept-Language
HTTP header.

* We should write some TODO notes about what we want to see
for our documentation listings.

* We should write some TODO notes about what we want to see
for our translation listings.

* In general, we always want less data in xmldata.  Try to
figure out ways to reduce the amount of information we need
to put in the XML.
